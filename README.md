ðŸ‘‹ Hey, [Kristian](https://twitter.com/signalnerve) from [Bytesized](https://bytesized.xyz) here. Byteconf is **a developer community for everyone** - I'm organizing free dev conferences and events, streamed online [on YouTube](https://www.bytesized.xyz/yt). 

**I want to put on conferences and events that are proposed by the community.** If I have an idea for a conference, I want your feedback too - _who would you like to see speak at the conference_? _What kind of topics do you want to see covered?_

**This repo** is where I'll track the conferences I _want_ to put on, the conferences I _am_ putting on, and every other pipe dream idea I have. I'll be submitting tickets for the things I'm interested in, but it's GitHub, so you should submit something too! 

For instance:
- A conference for your favorite language, like _Elixir_ or _Rust_
- An event focused around an idea, like _functional programming_, or _design for developers_
- A meta-twist on the Byteconf conference format itself! Maybe _in-person conferences_ (yes please), or a _100% lightning talk_ conference
- Anything else! ...as long as it's not [code of conduct](https://github.com/byteconf/ccoc) violating ðŸ¤—

OK, now on to the fun stuff. [**Submit your ideas here, by filing a ticket!**](https://github.com/byteconf/conferences/issues/new)

Have questions? Shoot me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/signalnerve). I'm super excited to see what y'all come up with ðŸ™Œ

## byteconf/conferences

üëã Hey, [Kristian](https://twitter.com/signalnerve) from [Byteconf](https://byteconf.com) here. Byteconf is **a developer community for everyone** - we're putting on free conferences and events, streamed online [on Twitch](https://byteconf.com/s/twitch). 

We're big fans of doing stuff _with_ our community - our first conference, [Byteconf React 2018](https://www.byteconf.com/react-2018), featured eight speakers chosen _by_ the community to talk about what's new and awesome in the React world. 

We've been thinking about how best to involve the community in pretty much _every_ aspect of Byteconf. For instance, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/byteconf), we'll ask daily questions about what you're working on, what new open-source projects you've discovered, etc. On [our Discord](https://byteconf.com/discord), developers from around the world discuss anything and everything, and together are building a place where we can all learn and grow as developers, together ‚ù§Ô∏è

**We want to put on conferences and events that are proposed by the community.** If we have an idea for a conference, we want your feedback too - _who would you like to see speak at the conference_? _What kind of topics do you want to see covered?_

**This repo** is where we'll track the conferences we _want_ to put on, the conferences we _are_ putting on, and every other pipe dream idea we have. I'll be submitting tickets for the things I'm interested in, but it's GitHub, so you should submit something too! 

For instance:
- A conference for your favorite language, like _Elixir_ or _Rust_
- An event focused around an idea, like _functional programming_, or _design for developers_
- A meta-twist on the Byteconf conference format itself! Maybe _in-person conferences_ (yes please), or a _100% lightning talk_ conference
- Anything else! ...as long as it's not [code of conduct](https://github.com/byteconf/ccoc) violating ü§ó

OK, now on to the fun stuff. [**Submit your ideas here, by filing a ticket!**](https://github.com/byteconf/conferences/issues/new)

Have questions? Join us on [our Discord](https://byteconf.com/discord), or shoot me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/signalnerve). I'm super excited to see what y'all come up with üôå
